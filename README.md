# GrowCube_Hacking

These are my notes reverse engineering the protocl used in Growcube. 

> Note: This is still very much a work in progress

## Tools used

I used Jadx to reverse engineer the Android app to get some insights in how the protocol works. 

I used Airtool 2 to sniff network traffic between the app and the device. You connect the phone via USB and tell it to sniff all traffic on the phone, it then fires up Wireshark with the result.

## Goal

The end goal of this project is to create a Python Growcube client library, and ultimately a proper Home Assistant integration.

The Python client repository is located [here](https://github.com/jonnybergdahl/Python-growcube-client).
The Home Assistant integration repository is located [here](https://github.com/jonnybergdahl/homeassistant_growcube).

> Note: They are both just work in progress.

## Android app reverse engineering

Static values in `NetConstant`:
```Java
    public static final int CONNCECT_BROKEN = 66;
    public static final int CONNCET_DEVICE_FAIL = 18;
    public static final int CONNCET_DEVICE_SUC = 17;
    public static final int DEVICE_CLOSE_PUMP_SUC = 69;
    public static final int DEVICE_OPEN_PUMP_SUC = 70;
    public static final int DEVICE_REC_CURVE_DATA = 71;
    public static final int DEVICE_REC_STH_DATA = 72;
    public static final int DEVICE_REC_WATER_VOLUME_DATA = 73;
    public static final int DEVICE_VERSION_UPDATE = 67;
    public static final int DEVICE_WIFI_NOT_CONFIG = 19;
    public static final int LISTEN_SERVER_FAIL = 34;
    public static final int LISTEN_SERVER_SUC = 33;
    public static final int PLANT_WATER_DATA_CHANGE = 80;
    public static final int UPDATE_WIKI_DATA = 81;
    public static final int WATER_CLOSE_OPEN_TIME_OUT = 53;
    public static final int WATER_CLOSS_FAIL = 51;
    public static final int WATER_CLOSS_SUC = 52;
    public static final int WATER_OPEN_FAIL = 50;
    public static final int WATER_OPEN_SUC = 49;
```

Static values in `NetManagerImp`: 
```Java
    public static final int CONNECT_PORT = 8800;
    public static final String IP_WIFI_SETTING = "192.168.1.125";
    private static final String KEY_CONNECT = "connect_device";
    private static final String KEY_CROW_RANDOM_NAME = "key_crow_random_name";
    public static final int PORT_BROCAST = 9527;
    public static final int PORT_WIFI_SETTING = 8800;
```

The class `NetManagerImp` is responsibÃ¶e for communication with the Growcube. Functions in that class that seems interesting to implement in the Python library:

  - `water(i, i2)` (ReqWater(i, i2))
  - `getCurveData(i)` (ReqCurveData(i))
  - `setWaterMode(i, i2. i3. i4)` (ReqWaterMode(i, i2, i3, i4))
  - `closeAotuMode(i)` (ReqClosePump(i))
  - `erasePlantCurveData(i)` (ReqPlantEnd(i))
  - `closeOutdoorMode(i)` (ReqSetWorkmode(0))
  - `openOutdoorMode()` (ReqSetWorkmode(1))

 And maybe:

  - `configWifi()`
  - `clearCurWifiInfo()`
  - `upgradeDevice()`
  - `restoreFactoryMode()`


There seems to be some kind of auto discovery implemented in `NetManagerImp`.

```Java
sendBracastMsg(PORT_BROCAST, "crowcube", new INetCallback()
...
DatagramPacket datagramPacket = (DatagramPacket) obj;
                            String hostAddress = datagramPacket.getAddress().getHostAddress();
                            String str = new String(datagramPacket.getData(), 0, datagramPacket.getLength());
                            LogUtil.d("ip:" + hostAddress + " id:" + str + " curid:" + NetManagerImp.curDevice.getIp());
```

## Communication

The device has an open TCP port on 8800. Connect to that using a raw socket, and it starts to peridocally write out messages. It also support accepting commands.

This is a sample output running Telnet, I just added a line feed to separate different messages.

```
Connected to 172.30.2.202.
Escape character is '^]'.
elea24#12#3.6@12663500#
elea28#1#0#
elea28#1#1#
elea28#1#3#
elea33#3#0@0#

elea21#10#2@23@45@25#
elea21#10#3@15@45@25#
```

Using Wireshark reveals the server is actually sending more data than what Telnet shows, a detail a parser will need to deal with.

### App communication

#### App startup

When the app starts, it connects to the Growcube and starts communication. 

The app starts by sending a `SyncTime` command with the current data and time. 
The device responds with a `RepVersionAndWater` response.

```
> elea44#19#2023@07@12@22@49@05#
< elea24#12#3.6@12663500#
```

The app sends a `SetWorkmode` command for mode `2`. It then continues
asking for data with a `CurveData` command for plant 0.

```
> elea43#1#2#
> elea48#1#0#
< elea22#83#0@2023@7@12@00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,95,96,00#
```

#### Idle traffic
The Growcube then continues sending out it's usual data stream.

```
< elea35#3#0@1#elea23#16#0@2023@6@19@6@38#
< elea35#3#0@1#elea23#16#0@2023@6@19@6@38#
< elea23#16#0@2023@6@19@6@40#
< elea23#16#0@2023@6@19@6@42#elea23#17#0@2023@6@22@18@21#
< elea23#17#0@2023@6@22@18@23#

```

## Message format

The messages are composed by the following parts.

Part | Description
---- | ----
"elea" | Message header
XX | Command/Response
"#" | Delimiter
NN | Length of the following data
data | Data, delimited by # delimiters and sub delimited by @ characters
"#" | End of data

## Response values

These are the "response" values as defined in the app.

Value | Description | Attributes | Sample value
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
20 | RepWaterState | Water warning | 1
21 | RepSTHSate | pump #, "st", "th", temperature | 0@50@49@24
22 | RepCurve | Pump data, pumpnum, yearData[], monthData[], dateData[] |
23 | RepAutoWater | pump #, time stamp divided (year, month, day, h, m) |
24 | RepVersionAndWater | version number (second value is ignored) | 3.6@12663500
25 | RepErasureData | Erasure state |
26 | RepPumpOpen | pump # | 3
27 | RepPumpClose | pump # | 3
33 | (Unknown) | ?? | 0@0

## Command values

These are the command values as defined in the app.

Value | Description | Attributes
---- | ---- | ---
43 | ReqSetWorkmode | mode
44 | ReqSyncTime | Current time
45 | ReqPlantEnd | pump #
46 | ReqClosePump | pump #
47 | ReqWater | pump #, state, 1 = Start pump, 0 = Stop pump 
48 | ReqCurveData | pump #
49 | WaterMode | sub data: pump #, mode, min value, max value
50 | WifiSettings | sub data: WiFi name, WiFi password, "time mils" = KEY_DEVICE_ID

There also seems to be some commands that does not use the normal syntax.

Value | Description
---- | ---
ele502| SyncWaterLevel
ele503| SyncWaterTime
ele504| Device upgrade command
ele505| Factory reset command

## Python test scripts

Python test scripts have been moved to the [Python library repo](https://github.com/jonnybergdahl/Python-growcube-client).
